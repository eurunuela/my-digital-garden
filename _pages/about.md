# Hi there, I'm Eneko üëã

<p class="block">I am a biomedical engineer and a second year graduate student at the <a href="https://www.bcbl.eu/en" target="_blank">Basque Center on Cognition, Brain and Language</a> in the <a href="https://www.bcbl.eu/en/research/research-groups/signal-processing-neuroimaging" target="_blank">Signal Processing in Neuroimaging lab</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EGyN5_YAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao" target="_blank">Dr. C√©sar Caballero-Gaudes</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=8o-d6B4AAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Dr. Miguel √Ångel Veganzones</a>. I'm primarily interested in optimization problems and applying them to functional MRI data (fMRI).</p>

I am an active contributor to [tedana](https://github.com/ME-ICA/tedana), a library for denoising multi-echo fMRI data, and the [physiopy suite](https://github.com/physiopy), a set of tools to work on your physiological data as well as making it BIDS compatible. I am also the chair of [Brainhack Donostia 2020](https://brainhack-donostia.github.io).

üî≠ I am currently working on methods for the spatio-temporal [[deconvolution]] of fMRI data, both single- and multi-echo, and tensor decomposition methods for the denoising of multi-echo fMRI data. I am also an active contributor to tedana and the physiopy suite.

üå± I am currently learning how to make all things BIDS, how to make an awesome Python package on GitHub and how to make the most of [RoamResearch](https://roamresearch.com).

üí¨ Ask me about deconvolution, tensor decomposition, tedana, physiopy or just about anything. I am always looking to learn new things!

üì´ How to reach me: you can email me or DM me on Twitter.

‚ö° Fun fact: I am a big fan of photography and rock music. I enjoy the occasional sunset photo and playing the guitar or the bass.
